- June 12th University of Sheffield
- Bartolome House, Seminar Room EG03

# Course Overview

The workshop is designed to give you an introduction on using **Cytoscape** – a network-based software application to perform bioinformatics data and pathway enrichment analysis. The particular use-case is that of RNA-seq data, but many of the concepts are used for other types of analysis. There are several reasons why we might want to use Cytoscpae in Bioinformatics:- <br></br>
* You can be a non-programmer and want to analyse your biological datasets generated by “high-throughput sequencing”.
* You have performed the required data-tidiness using R or Python (programming langugaes) and want to create neat networks for publishing your results. 

## Cytoscape packages.
* The packages within Cytoscape provides a user complete support for different types of “-Omics” datasets. 
  *	e.g. many NGS tools are developed for a Unix envi3
  
  +-----------------speed than we have on our own machine
*	Some analyses take too long, and whilst they are running everything else on our machine will be slow
*	Eventually you will want to use “High-performance computing” (HPC) - but this requires some background knowledge before you can use it
